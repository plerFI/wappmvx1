            AuctOZ acts as a delegator between 5 selected and modifiable lending pools or vaults. The goal is to always deposit your money in the best pool and thereby get the maximum return. AuctOZ is a project that is constantly being improved. The design has been kept simple and straightforward for the beginning in order to make the functions available as quickly as possible.

            {renderText(`
            AuctOZ is for everyone on the Base network who wants to invest their USDC as simply and quickly as possible over the long term. Since AuctOZ only uses selected and verified pools, there is a high level of security.

            {renderText(`
            Behind this web app is a complex SmartContract that delegates your investment. There are repeated test phases which test the return of the pools and then select the best pool in which the majority of the USDC are invested. A vault token is minted for all funds invested, which shows your vault volume. It also acts as a confirmation so that you can make a withdrawal.

            <h6 className='text-themeGreen/80 font-Pooppins uppercase text-xl tracking-widest font-semibold mb-6'>What is the fee structure of AuctOZ?</h6>
            {renderText(`
            AuctOZ does not pursue any financial interest. 
            There is only one fee.

            â—‹ The performance fee of AuctOZ, which is set at 5% at the start. The sole purpose of this fee is to offset the server and gas cost.
            `)}
            {renderText(`
            The motto of this fee is; the higher the volume the lower the fee! As soon as the costs are covered, the fee will be adjusted.
